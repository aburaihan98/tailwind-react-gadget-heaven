### List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project:

1. JSX (JavaScript XML):
   A syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to create React elements.

2. Components:
   The building blocks of a React application. Components can be either class components or functional components.
   Functional Components: Simpler and often preferred, especially with hooks.
   Class Components: More complex, can manage state and lifecycle methods.

3. Props (Properties):
   A way to pass data from parent to child components. Props are read-only and help make components reusable.

4. State:
   An object that holds data that may change over the lifecycle of a component. State is managed within a component and can be updated with setState() in class components or useState() hook in functional components.

5. Hooks:
   Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
   Common hooks include:
   useState(): Manages state in functional components.
   useEffect(): Manages side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
   useContext(): Allows you to consume context values.

6. Context API:
   A way to manage state globally without prop drilling. It allows you to share values (like themes or user information) between components without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree.

7. Conditional Rendering:
   Techniques to render components or elements based on certain conditions, often using JavaScript operators like if, ternary operators, or logical operators.

8. Lists and Keys:
   Rendering lists of data using the .map() method and ensuring each element has a unique "key" prop for optimal rendering performance.

### I have used for handling and managing data:

### 5 features of website/project:

1. Active route in the Navbar
2. The number of items in Cart and Wish list is shown on the right side of Navbar by Cart icon and wish list icon.
3. The sidebar on the left side of the Main section contains all the categories. When the user clicks on the category, it will show the items of that category on the right side.
4. Clicking on the View details button of any product will take the user to the details page of that particular product. And the user can add that specific product to the cart or wish list if he wants.
5. Clicking the Dashboard button in the NavBar will take the user to the Dashboard, and clicking the Cart button will show the cart items and clicking the wish list button will show the Wish list items. User can delete any item from Cart or Wish list.
